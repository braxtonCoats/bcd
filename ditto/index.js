When designs were being handed over to developers, if there wasn’t an explicit mockup of every single interaction for ever signle component, then errors would happen. \n\nOn top of this,  Bandwidth had recently aquired another company that had their own GUI which my team of 3 people had now inherited. So now, on top of having to teach new designers and developers about how to implement and design using the undocumented system, we now had to teach ourselves about the new interface and learn how to design for that system as well."

Something had to change and we had to start designing for something new. \n\nI took it upon myself to start re-creating everything in the new GUI (lovingly reffered to as Portal 2) so that the team can start designing using those new components. \n\nAs I was recreating the components, I would find myself trying to figure out how each of them was used in Portal 2. My progress would slow down exponentially when I did this. So I decided that when I had finished creating each new component, I would go through Portal 2 and determine where and how each component was used. \n\nOnce I had a decently full sheet of documentation for each compoent, I needed a platform to showcase the documentation. To allow designers, developers, and anyone else the opprotunity to learn about the paterns that were used in Portal 2 and how to keep new designs inline with those patterns.\n\nUsing Zeroheight, I was able to produce a design system that seemed like it had been built from the ground up with care and attention put into every detail of every flow and component. But when it was actually just a recreation of what already existed. \n\nWe would use this version of the design system (we called BluePrint v0.5) to lay out the foundation of what we wanted our future design system to be. Testing it with other designers and devs, we were able to determine what the design system covered well and identify places where it lacked. Using this information the UX team would be able to start iterating on layouts, components and flows to further improve not only the usability of Portal 2, but of the design system as well. "

When designs were being handed over to developers, if there wasn’t an explicit mockup of every single interaction for ever signle component, then errors would happen. \n\nOn top of this,  Bandwidth had recently aquired another company that had their own GUI which my team of 3 people had now inherited. So now, on top of having to teach new designers and developers about how to implement and design using the undocumented system, we now had to teach ourselves about the new interface and learn how to design for that system as well."

Something had to change and we had to start designing for something new. \n\nI took it upon myself to start re-creating everything in the new GUI (lovingly reffered to as Portal 2) so that the team can start designing using those new components. \n\nAs I was recreating the components, I would find myself trying to figure out how each of them was used in Portal 2. My progress would slow down exponentially when I did this. So I decided that when I had finished creating each new component, I would go through Portal 2 and determine where and how each component was used. \n\nOnce I had a decently full sheet of documentation for each compoent, I needed a platform to showcase the documentation. To allow designers, developers, and anyone else the opprotunity to learn about the paterns that were used in Portal 2 and how to keep new designs inline with those patterns.\n\nUsing Zeroheight, I was able to produce a design system that seemed like it had been built from the ground up with care and attention put into every detail of every flow and component. But when it was actually just a recreation of what already existed. \n\nWe would use this version of the design system (we called BluePrint v0.5) to lay out the foundation of what we wanted our future design system to be. Testing it with other designers and devs, we were able to determine what the design system covered well and identify places where it lacked. Using this information the UX team would be able to start iterating on layouts, components and flows to further improve not only the usability of Portal 2, but of the design system as well. "
